# ContactsFrameworkDemo

Explored the new Contacts Framework in iOS9. 
This app is very basic in terms of functionality. 
The app tries to get all contacts from the phone and display it in a table view. 

I used the following references to get this working:

1. WWDC 2015 Session 223: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/223/
2. AppCoda tutorial: http://www.appcoda.com/ios-contacts-framework/
